# HW3_Deep_Learning_BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model that has been successfully applied to a variety of NLP tasks, including question answering. Here are the steps to apply BERT on a spoken SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) dataset:

Data preparation: The first step is to prepare the spoken SQuAD dataset for BERT. This includes preprocessing the dataset to ensure that it is in a format that BERT can understand. This may involve converting the audio files to text using automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology, and then cleaning and formatting the resulting text data.

Tokenization: Next, the text data must be tokenized so that it can be processed by BERT. This involves breaking the text into individual tokens or words, and then mapping each token to a unique ID that BERT can understand.

Embedding: BERT is a deep neural network that requires input in the form of word embeddings. These embeddings are dense vectors that represent each word in the input text. BERT uses a technique called contextual embedding, which means that each word is represented by a vector that takes into account its context within the sentence.

Fine-tuning: Once the data has been prepared, tokenized, and embedded, the next step is to fine-tune the BERT model on the spoken SQuAD dataset. Fine-tuning involves training the model on the dataset, using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to improve its performance on the task of question answering.

Evaluation: After fine-tuning, the model must be evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance. This involves calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which indicate how well the model is able to answer questions correctly.

Inference: Finally, the trained model can be used for inference on new spoken SQuAD datasets. Given a question and a passage of spoken text, the model can predict the most likely answer to the question.
